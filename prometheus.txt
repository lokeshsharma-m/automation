prometheus tracks and stores time series.

time series are numeric values that change over time and that are sampled at specific points in time,usually whenever prometheus pulls 
metrics from a target

prometheus:its a metrics-based monitoring system that helps you to ensure that your systems and services are healthy and behaving well.

pull based monitoring system that pulls metrics over http form a set of systems and services that you want to monitor.

prometheus:Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability in modern, dynamic environments. 
           It collects time-series data metrics from monitored targets, stores it in a time-series database, and enables powerful queries, alerting, and visualization.

allow users to incorporate AI and ML algorithms through third-party plugins or extensions. One such extension is Prometheus Autotune.

prometheus autotune:Prometheus Autotune is an open-source project that extends Prometheus with automated tuning capabilities. It leverages AI and ML algorithms to analyze historical metric data,
 			  predict future trends, and automatically adjust Prometheus configuration parameters to optimize resource usage and performance.

Data Collection: Prometheus collects time-series metrics data from various components of the e-commerce website infrastructure, such as web servers, 
			application servers, databases, and network devices.

AI Analysis: Prometheus Autotune analyzes historical metric data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in traffic volume, user activity, 
			and resource utilization during seasonal sale events.

Predictive Analytics: Based on historical data analysis, Prometheus Autotune predicts future traffic patterns and resource demands during seasonal sale periods, 
			considering factors such as date, time, past sale events, and promotional activities.

Auto-tuning: Prometheus Autotune automatically adjusts Prometheus configuration parameters, such as scraping intervals, 
		retention periods, and alerting thresholds, to accommodate anticipated traffic surges and ensure optimal monitoring and resource allocation.

Optimization: By automatically tuning Prometheus configuration parameters based on predicted traffic patterns, 
			Prometheus Autotune helps optimize resource usage, improve monitoring efficiency, and ensure reliable performance during seasonal sale events.

Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is a popular optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively 
adjusting model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the gradient.

Genetic Algorithms: Genetic algorithms are optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. 
They involve creating a population of candidate solutions and iteratively selecting, mutating, and recombining them to find the optimal solution.

Linear Regression: Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and 
one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

Time-Series Forecasting: Time-series forecasting algorithms, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or
 exponential smoothing methods, are used to predict future values of a time-series based on historical observations.

Machine Learning Models: Prometheus Autotune may employ various machine learning models, such as decision trees, random forests, 
or neural networks, to analyze historical data, identify patterns, and make predictions.

Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning or deep reinforcement learning methods, 
could potentially be used to learn optimal strategies for adjusting Prometheus configuration parameters based on feedback from the environment.
